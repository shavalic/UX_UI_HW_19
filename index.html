        <h1>Sabina Havalic</h1>
        <p>I’m currently a student enrolled in Northwestern University's UX/UI Bootcamp and will be looking for a career as a qualitative UX Researcher.
          From discovery efforts to creating user personas to usability testing, I look forward to playing an active role in moving projects forward - always excited about learning new methodologies and practices as I go!
          With a BS in Animal Science and experience in wildlife biology field research all around the world, I bring a unique approach and perspective while collaborating on UX/UI projects.</p>

        <h3> User Research</h3>
        <p> I approach research with an open mind and concrete goals. Aside from user interviews and usability tests, I love collaborating with my team identifying relationships, patterns, and similarities among data using affinity diagrams and feature prioritization matrices.

        <h3> User Empathy</h3>
        <p> It’s always fun to start by creating a proto-persona!  Then, to really understand who the user is and their needs, I generate user personas using combinations of results from interviews, empathy mapping, surveys, and affinity diagrams.</p>

        <h3> Qualitative Interviews</h3>
        <p> One of my favorite parts of UX research is conducting qualitative interviews. I start with a plan identifying clear objectives and goals and love incorporating the 5 Whys Method while asking intro, problem ID, and behavioral questions.</p>
